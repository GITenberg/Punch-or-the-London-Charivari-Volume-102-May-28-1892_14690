    <h2>VENICE RESERVED.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>A Sketch from a Numbered Stall at Olympia.</i>)</h4>

    <p>On the Stage, the Scene represents "A Public Place before
    the Arsenal," where a number of artisans are apparently busily
    engaged in making horse-shoes on cold anvils in preparation for
    the launch of "<i>The Adriatica</i>." On extreme R. enter
    <i>Antonio</i>, who expresses commercial embarrassment by going
    through a sort of dumb-bell exercise on a bridge. On extreme L.
    enter <i>Bassanio</i>, <i>Lorenzo</i>, and <i>Antonio</i>, who
    observe, with mild surprise, that there are several other
    persons present, and proceed to point out objects of local
    interest to one another with the officious amiability of
    persons in the foreground of hotel advertisements. (<i>Here a
    Small Boy in a box, who has an impression he is going to see a
    Pantomime, inquires audibly "when the Clown Part will begin?"
    and has to be answered and consoled.</i>) <i>Bassanio</i>
    perceives <i>Antonio</i> afar off, and advances towards him
    with stately deliberation, throwing out signals with one arm at
    intervals; <i>Antonio</i> goes to meet him; they shake each
    other by both hands with affectionate cordiality, and then turn
    their backs on one another, as though, on reflection, they
    found they had less to say than they had imagined. Presently
    <i>Bassanio</i> recollects why he wanted to see <i>Antonio</i>
    so particularly, and, by describing a circle in the air, and
    pointing from the electric lights above to the balcony stalls
    in front, and tapping his belt, puts <i>Antonio</i> at once in
    possession of his chronic impecuniosity, his passion for
    <i>Portia</i>, and his need for a small temporary loan.
    <i>Antonio</i> curls up his fists, raises them to the level of
    his ears, and then pretends to take his heart out of his
    doublet and throw it at <i>Bassanio</i>, who fields it with
    graceful dexterity, instantly comprehending with Italian
    intuition that his friend is, like himself, rather pressed for
    ready money, but is prepared to back a bill for any amount.
    <i>Shylock</i> passes that way, and is introduced by
    <i>Antonio</i> as a gentleman in the city who is in the habit
    of making advances on personal security without inquiry.
    <i>Shylock</i> extracts imaginary ink from his chest, and
    writes with one hand on the palm of the other, and cringingly
    produces a paper-knife&mdash;whereupon the transaction is
    complete, and the parties, becoming aware that a Grand
    Triumphal Procession is waiting to come in, and that they are
    likely to be in the way, tactfully suggest to one another the
    propriety of retiring. After the Procession, <i>Valentina</i>,
    "the lovely daughter of the proud <i>Visconti</i>" embarks on a
    barge with her maidens to meet her betrothed.</p>

    <p>(<i>In the Stalls, a Lady with a Catalogue, who hasn't been
    here before, mistakes this proceeding for "The Launch of the
    Adriatica," but is set right by a friend who has, and is
    consequently able to inform her that</i> Valentina <i>is</i>
    Portia <i>on her way to plead against</i> Shylock.)</p>

             alt="Signals to Portia." /></a>"Signals to Portia that
             it is not such an amusing game as he thought."
    </div>

    <p>A mimic battle takes place on a bridge&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>,
    rival factions shake their fists with prudent defiance over one
    another's shoulders. (<i>An Old Lady in the Balcony, who has
    been watching this desperate encounter, finds that she has
    missed a very important Scene between</i> Shylock <i>and</i>
    Jessica <i>at the other end of the stage, and remorsefully
    resolves to be more observant in future, as the Scene changes
    to "Portia's Palatial Home."</i>) <i>Portia</i> enters (<i>the
    Lady in the Stalls, who has been here before, tells her
    companion that</i> Portia's <i>dress was "lovely when it was
    clean</i>"), and greets her guests by extending both arms and
    inviting them to inspect the palms of her hands, thereby
    intimating that the abundance of canopied recesses, and the
    absence of any furniture to sit down upon, is due to the fact
    that the apartment has been recently cleared for a parlour
    game. The company express a well-bred gratification by bowing.
    Enter the <i>Prince of Morocco (who is of course identified by
    various Spectators in the Stalls without Catalogues as</i>
    "Othello," <i>or "the Duke of Thingumbob</i>&mdash;you <i>know
    the chap I mean</i>"), followed by his retinue; he kisses
    <i>Portia's</i> hand, as she explains to him, the <i>Prince of
    Arragon</i>, and <i>Bassanio</i>, the rules of the game in
    three simple gestures. They reply, by flourishes, that they
    have frequently played it at home, and promise faithfully not
    to cheat. The three caskets are brought in and placed on a
    table; the <i>Prince of Morocco</i> is the first player, and
    walks towards them very slowly, stopping at every ten paces and
    signalling to <i>Portia</i> that he is all right so far, and
    that she is not to be at all uneasy on his account. On coming
    in sight of the caskets, he pauses and turns to the audience,
    as if it had only just occurred to him that the odds were two
    to one against him, and he must be careful. Presently he jerks
    his right arm above his head and strikes his forehead, to
    indicate a happy thought, rushes at the golden casket, opens
    it, and slams the lid disgustedly. After which he signals to
    <i>Portia</i> that it is not such an amusing game as he
    thought, and he doesn't mean to play any more, beckons to his
    retinue and goes off, throwing his cloak over his shoulder with
    a gesture of manly and not unnatural annoyance. The <i>Prince
    of Arragon</i> tries the silver casket next, with similar
    unsuccess. Then <i>Bassanio</i>&mdash;with an elaborate
    pretence of uncertainty, considering he can hardly have helped
    witnessing the proceedings&mdash;advances to the caskets, in
    front of which he performs a little mental calculation, finally
    arriving at the conclusion that, as the portrait is not in the
    gold and silver boxes, it may not improbably be in the leaden
    one. He actually <i>does</i> find it there, and exhibits it to
    <i>Portia</i> with extreme astonishment, as if it was quite the
    <i>last</i> thing he expected. Then he advances to meet her,
    comparing her frequently with the picture, and expressing his
    approval of it as a likeness, and his determination to be taken
    by the same artist. Mutual satisfaction, interrupted by the
    arrival of a gondola with a letter from <i>Antonio</i>. To read
    it and impart its contents and the entire history of the bond
    to <i>Portia</i>, by a semicircular sweep of the arm and
    sounding his chest, takes <i>Bassanio</i> exactly two seconds
    and a half, after which he departs in the gondola, and the
    scene changes to the Piazzetta, where a variety of exciting
    events&mdash;including the Trial, a Musical Ballet, and a Call
    to Arms&mdash;take place, culminating in the embarkation of
    Venetian soldiers to recapture Chioggia, in three highly
    ornamental but slightly unseaworthy barges, as the Curtain
    falls on Act I.</p>

    <p>Interval of Fifteen Minutes, spent by some of the lady
    spectators in speculation whether the dark and light patches on
    the blue curtains are due to design or the action of damp.
    After which the Fortress of Chioggia is disclosed, with a
    bivouac of the Genoese garrison. A bevy of well-meaning maidens
    enter with fruit and vegetables for the military, but, on the
    discovery that their wares are properties, and too firmly glued
    to the baskets to be detached, they retire in confusion. A
    small sail is seen behind the battlements; the soldiers poke at
    it with halberds until it retreats, whereupon, soldier-like,
    they dance. The sail returns with a still smaller one; red fire
    is burnt under the walls, which so demoralises the Genoese
    soldiery that they all tumble down with precaution, and the
    Venetians burst in and stand over them in attitudes as the
    scene changes to an Island near Venice and a Grand Aquatic
    Procession. (<i>Here intelligent Spectators in the Stalls
    identify the first four pairs of gondolas,&mdash;which are
    draped respectively in icicles, pale green, rose-colour, and
    saffron,&mdash;as typifying the Seasons; another pair come in
    draped in violet, which they find some difficulty in
    satisfactorily accounting for. When two more appear hung with
    white and gold with a harp and palette at the prows, they grow
    doubtful, and the entrance of the two last couples, which carry
    shrines and images, reduces them to hopeless mystification. The
    Small Boy wishes to know whether anybody will be upset in the
    water, and being told that this is not a fixture in the
    entertainment, conceives a poor opinion of the capacity of
    Mediæval Venice for lighthearted revelry.</i>)</p>

    <p>Terrace near Portia's Palace, <i>Portia</i>, <i>Bassanio</i>
    and the <i>Doge</i> discovered enjoying a pasteboard
    banquet.</p>

    <p>(<i>A Lady in the Stalls "wonders whether it is correct to
    represent</i> Portia <i>as knowing a Doge so intimately as all
    that," and doubts whether it is in Shakspeare.</i>)</p>

    <p>The supper-table is removed, and the proceedings terminate
    by a Grand Al Fresco Carnival. Ladies of the ballet dance
    bewitchingly, while soldiers play at Bo-Peep behind enormous
    red hoops. Finally the entire strength of the ballet link arms
    in one immense line, and simultaneously execute a wonderful
    chromatic kick, upon which the blue draperies descend amidst
    prolonged and thoroughly well-deserved applause from a
    delighted audience.</p>

    <blockquote class="note">
        <p>[At the meeting of the Women's Liberal Federation the
        following "operative mandatory resolution" was
        carried:&mdash;"That in pursuance of the resolution passed
        in May 1890, the Council now instructs the Executive
        Committee that they shall promote the enfranchisement of

        women, who possess any of the legal qualifications enabling

        <p>SCENE&mdash;<i>"At the Nets" on the St. Stephen's
        Cricket Ground. "The Champion" has been practising in the
        interval, prior to playing in the Great Match of the
        Season, "Unionists v. Home-Rulers." Various admiring
        Volunteers of both sexes have been "scouting" for
        him.</i></p>
    </blockquote>

    <div class="drama">
        <p><i>First Admiring Bystander.</i> By Jove, that was a
        slashing hit! What powder he puts into it, eh? At
        <i>his</i> age too!</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Oh, the Grand Old 'Un's in great form
        this season. Like 'tother W.G., who's just back from the
        Antipodes and, at forty-four, can knock up his sixty-three
        in sixty-five minutes. There he goes again, clean over all
        the "scouts"!</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Oh! he gives 'em plenty to do, "in the
        country." Keeps 'em on the shift, eh?</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Bless you, yes. Why a hit like that,
        <i>run out</i>, would be worth seven to his side-<i>in</i>
        a match!</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> (<i>knowingly</i>). Ah, but I notice
        that <i>in a match</i> these tremendous swipes don't always
        come off, don'tcher-know. I've seen some tremendous
        sloggers at the nets make a wonderful poor show when
        between wickets with a watchful "field" round 'em.</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> (<i>with candour</i>). Ah, quite so,
        of course. Everyone must have noticed that. With a demon
        bowler in front of yer sending 'em down like
        hundred-tonners, and a blarmed cat of a wicket-keeper on
        the grab just at your back, not to mention a pouncer at
        point, it puzzles the best of them to get 'em away, though
        "in a position of greater freedom and less responsibility,"
        practising at the nets, to wit, with only the ground-bowler
        and a few scouts fielding, they may punish 'em
        properly.</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Ah, well, one must allow that the
        Champion plays the game right away all the time.</p>

        <p><i>Second A B.</i> Yea. Age cannot wither him, nor
        custom stale his infinite variety. Wonderful, all the same,
        what perversely bad hits he will persist in making, at
        times. Does things now and again you'd think a school-girl
        with a bat would be ashamed of.</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Ah, by the way, what do you think of
        these here new-fangled Lady-Cricketers?</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> (<i>significantly</i>). Ask the Old
        'Un what <i>he</i> thinks of 'em.</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Ah! can't abide 'em, can he? And yet
        he likes the Ladies to look on and applaud, and even to
        field for him at times.</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Yes; the Ladies have been good
        friends of his, and now he'd bar them from the legitimate
        game. I fancy it's put their backs up a bit, eh?</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> You bet! And it <i>do</i> seem
        ray-ther ongrateful like, don't it now? Though as fur as
        that goes <i>I</i> don't believe Cricket's a game for the
        petticoats.</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Nor me neither. But bless yer they
        gets their foot in in everything now; tennis, and golf, and
        rowing and cetrer. And if you let 'em in at all, for your
        own pleasure, I don't quite see how you're going to draw
        the line arbitrary like just where it suits <i>you</i>, as
        the Grand Old Slogger seems to fancy.</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> No; and, if you ask me, I say they
        won't stand it, even from <i>him.</i> "No," says they,
        "fair's fair," they says. "All very well to treat us like
        volunteer scouts at a country game, or at the nets,
        returning the balls whilst you slog and show off. But when
        we want to put on the gloves and pads, and take a hand at
        the bat in a businesslike way, you boggle, and hint that
        it's degrading, unsexing, and all that stuff."</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Ah, <i>that</i> won't wash. If it
        unsexes 'em to bat, it unsexes 'em to scout. And if the old
        cricketing gang didn't want the Ladies between wickets,
        why, they shouldn't have let em into the field, <i>I</i>
        say. Strikes me Lady CARLISLE'll show 'em a thing or two.
        That "operative mandatory resolution" of hers means
        mischief&mdash;<i>after</i> the next big match anyhow.
        "Ladies wait, and wait a bit more, wait in truth till the
        day after to-morrow." Yes; but they won't wait for
        ever.</p>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Not they. Why, look yonder! There's
        one of 'em in full fig. Lady-Cricketer from cap to
        shoes&mdash;short skirt, knickers, belt, blouse, gloves,
        and all the rest of it. D'ye think that sort means
        volunteer scouting only? Not a bit of it. Mean playing the
        game, Sir, and having regular teams of their own.</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Look at her! She's a speaking to the
        Grand Old Champion
        himself!</p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page255"
           id="page255"></a>[pg 255]</span>

        <p><i>First A.B.</i> Giving him a bit of her mind, you bet.
        What's that she's saying?</p>

        <p><i>Second A.B.</i> Why, that she admires his style
        immensely, and doesn't want to spoil his game; but that,
        <i>after</i> the next great All England Match, if not
        sooner, they mean to have a team of their own and go in
        for the game all round!</p>

    <h2>CONFESSIONS OF A DUFFER.</h2>

    <h3>No. X.&mdash;THE DUFFER ON THE TURF.</h3>

    <p>"A horse for a protection is a deceitful thing," as the
    Scotch translator of KING DAVID has it, and I entirely agree
    with him. I rather wish to be protected from a horse, than
    expect any succour from a creature so large, muscular and
    irrational. Far from being "courageous," as his friends say,
    the horse (I am not speaking of the war-horse) is afraid of
    almost everything, that is why I am afraid of him. He is a most
    nervous animal, and I am a nervous rider. He is afraid of a
    bicycle or a wheel-barrow, which do not alarm the most timid
    bipeds, and when he is afraid he shies, and when he shies I no
    longer remain. Irrational he is, or he would not let people
    ride him, however, I never met a horse that would let <i>me</i>
    do so. It is with the horse as an instrument of gambling that I
    am concerned. In that sense I have "backed" him, in no other
    sense to any satisfactory result. With all his four legs he
    stumbles more than one does with only a pair, an extraordinary
    proof of his want of harmony with his environment.</p>

    <p>I was beguiled on to the Turf by winning a small family
    sweepstakes&mdash;£3 in fact. A sporting cousin told me that I
    had better "put it on <i>Cauliflower</i>," who was the
    favourite for The City and Suburban. He put it on
    <i>Cauliflower</i> for me, and we won, so that a career of easy
    opulence seemed open. Then I took to backing horses, a brief
    madness. I read all the sporting papers, and came to the
    conclusion that the prophets are naught. If you look at their
    vaticinations, you will find that they all select their winners
    out of the first four favourites. Anybody could do that. Now
    the first four favourites do not by any means always win, and,
    when they do, how short are the odds you get&mdash;hardly worth
    mentioning! Horses occasionally win with odds of forty to one
    against them, <i>these</i> are the animals of which I was in
    search, not the hackneyed favourites of the Press and the
    Public. This, I think you will find, is usually the attitude of
    the Duffer, who, in my time, was known, I cannot say why, as
    the "Juggins." I liked to bring a little romance into my
    speculations. Often I have backed a horse for his name, for
    something curious, or literary, or classical about his name.
    <i>Xanthus</i>, or <i>Podargus</i>, or <i>Phäeton</i>, or
    <i>Lampusa</i> has often carried my investment to an
    inconspicuous position in the ruck. Another plan of mine, which
    I believe every Duffer adopts, was backing my
    dreams&mdash;those horses of air. About the time of the Derby
    one always reads about lucky persons who backed a dream. But
    one does not read about the unlucky persons who take the same
    precaution. Several millions of people in this country read,
    talk, and think about nothing but racehorses. When the
    Socialists have their way, may I advise them to keep up
    Government or communal racing studs and stables? What the
    betting is to be done in, if there is no money (which is
    contemplated as I understand), is not obvious. But the people
    will insist on having races, and what is a race without a bet?
    However, these considerations wander from the subject in hand.
    With a fourth of the population thinking about horses, a large
    proportion must dream about horses. Out of these dreams,
    perhaps one in one hundred and fifty thousand comes true, and
    about that dream we read in the papers. We don't read about the
    other dreams, such as mine were, for I have dreamed of winning
    numbers, winning colours, winning horses, but my dreams came
    all through the Ivory Gate, and my money followed them.</p>

             alt="'Yet here I was finally unsuccessful.'" />
             </a>"Yet here I was finally unsuccessful."
    </div>

    <p>I don't pretend to be a judge of a horse; except for their
    colour they all seem pretty much alike to me. Nor did I haunt
    race-courses much, people there are often very unrefined, and
    the Ring is extremely noisy and confusing. Once I heard a man
    offering to lay considerable odds against the Field, and I
    offered in a shy and hesitating manner, to accept them. He
    asked me what horse I backed? I said none in particular, the
    Field at large, all of them, for really the odds seemed very
    remarkable. But he did not accede to my wishes, and continued
    to shout in rather a discourteous manner. Once, too, when I had
    won some money, I lost it all on the way back, at a simple sort
    of game of cards, not nearly so complex and difficult as whist.
    One need only to say which of three cards, in the dealer's
    hand, was the card one had chosen. Yet here I was finally
    unsuccessful, though fortunate at first, and I am led to
    suppose that some kind of sleight of hand had been employed;
    or, perhaps, that the card of my choice had in some manner been
    smuggled away. However, once on a racecourse I saw a horse
    which I fancied on his merits. He looked very tall and strong,
    and was of a pretty colour, also he had a nice tail. He was
    hardly mentioned in the betting, and I got "on" at seventy to
    one, very reasonable odds. I backed him then, and he won, with
    great apparent ease, for his jockey actually seemed to be
    holding him in, rather than spurring him in the regrettable way
    which you sometimes see. But when I went to look for the person
    with whom I had made my bet, I was unable to find him anywhere,
    and I have never met him since. He had about him ten pounds,
    the amount of my bet, which he had insisted on receiving as a
    deposit, "not necessarily for publication," he said, "but as a
    guarantee of good faith." Race-courses are crowded, confusing
    places, and I doubt not, that so scrupulous a man was also
    looking for me. But we have never met. If this meets his eye,
    probably he will send a cheque for £700 to the office of <i>Mr.
    Punch</i>. I have often regretted the circumstance, as it was
    my most fortunate <i>coup</i> on the Turf, and above all,
    reflected credit on my judgment of a horse.</p>

    <p>Conversing afterwards with a friend on this event, I
    expressed surprise that <i>my</i> horse had not been a
    favourite, considering his agreeable exterior.</p>

    <p>"Why, you Juggins," he answered, "<i>Rumtifoo</i> was a
    moral&mdash;everybody knew <i>that</i>; but everybody knew he
    wasn't meant; he was being kept for the Polehampton Stakes. He
    only won because he got the better of little BOTHERBY, his
    jockey, who couldn't hold him. Why, the crowd nearly murdered
    him, and his master sacked him on the spot&mdash;the little
    idiot!"</p>

    <p>I do not quite understand this explanation. Poor <i>Rumtifoo
    was</i> "moral," like the "moral mare" mentioned by ARISTOTLE
    in the <i>Ethics</i>. He did his best to win, and he did win;
    what else can you ask for in a horse?</p>

    <p>There is, apparently, more in horse-racing than meets the
    eye. I am not addicted to remembering much about the "previous
    performances" of horses, as some men are, who will tell you
    that <i>Cynic</i> was third in the Kelso Hunt Cup for last
    year, and that you ought to keep an eye on him for the Ayrshire
    Handicap. But I have remarked that horses are not like men;
    they do not always run almost equally well, though the
    conditions of the race seem similar. No doubt this is owing to
    the nervousness of the animal, who may be discouraged by the
    noise, the smell of bad tobacco, and so forth.</p>

    <p>I have given up Racing. That was after last year's Ascot
    meeting. I was staying at a country house, some days before,
    and somehow I lost my betting-book. It is really extraordinary
    how things do get <span class="pagenum"><a name="page257"
       id="page257"></a>[pg 257]</span> lost. Perhaps I left it in
       a railway carriage. Afterwards I tried to put my bets, as
       far as I could remember them, down on a large sheet of
       paper, and I think I got it very nearly right. But I left
       the paper lying about in the library in a very interesting
       first edition of <i>Plotinus</i>, I believe, and either the
       housemaid burned it, or my host threw it into the
       waste-paper basket. At all events, it was lost, and I have
       no head for figures, and things got mixed somehow. The
       book-maker's recollection of the circumstances was not the
       same as mine. But I began quite a fresh book, on imaginative
       principles, on the course. I had not a good Ascot. And as
       Racing gives me a headache, and I seldom meet any people on
       the Turf who are at all interested in the same things as
       myself, I have given it up for good. They say I am a good
       deal regretted by the Ring. It is always pleasant to
       remember having made a favourable impression.</p>

    <h2>THE OPERA-GOER'S DIARY.</h2>

    <p><i>Monday, May 16.</i>&mdash;Sound the trumpets, Beat the
    drums! All Hail to Sir DRURIOLANUS OPERATICUS, the most
    successful Knight of the Season! A brilliant audience in a
    brilliant house lighted by thousands of additional electric
    lights, acclaimed with rapture the awakening of Opera.
    <i>Philémon et Baucis</i> began it, a work by GOUNOD (which is
    not intended for swearing) of great sweetness and light; and
    this was followed by PIETRO MASCAGNI's <i>Cavalleria
    Rusticana</i>, "Rustic Chivalry," which might be
    epigrammatically described as a "Clod-hoppera." <i>Philémon et
    Baucis</i> is charming. M. MONTARIOL was a capital
    <i>Philémon</i>, and Mlle. SIGRID ARNOLDSEN as <i>Baucis</i>, a
    sort of classical Little Bo-peep, received a hearty welcome on
    her return to the Covent Garden House and Home. M. PLANÇON was
    the thoroughly French <i>Jupin</i>, and M. CASTELMARY an
    amiable <i>Vulcan</i>; both most accomplished Divines.
    Altogether, a perfect quartette. The graceful <i>intermezzo</i>
    only escaped an <i>encore</i> because the knowing ones among
    the gods and groundlings felt that too much enthusiasm at first
    might do serious damage to the subsequent reception of the
    great <i>intermezzo</i> of the evening. All on <i>qui vive</i>
    for great <i>intermezzo</i>. Anticipations of event heard in
    the lobbies. Anxiety depicted on some countenances, but most
    features looking happy and hopeful. The members of what was
    once known as "the Organising Committee" nod encouragingly to
    one another as they pass to and fro; the officials and
    <i>habitués</i> exchange greetings without any expression of
    opinion. Sir DRURIOLANUS does not issue forth until the right
    moment, when he can shut up his opera-glass with a click, and
    give the word to Field-Marshal MANCINELLI to lead his men to
    the attack. For the present, "Wait" is the <i>mot d'ordre</i>,
    "and this," quoth a jig-maker, "is the only weight in the
    entire entertainment."</p>

        </a>The Good and Great Archbishop Druriolanus
        Coventgardenus giving his Chorus Flock permission to use
        Palms on Easter Sunday. Quite "the palmy days" of the
        Opera.
    </div>

    <p>Up goes the Curtain, and those who remember the
    <i>Cavalleria</i> as it was put on "in another place," to use
    parliamentary language, see at the first glance that this
    representation is going to be quite another pair of shoes. The
    stage management is admirable: not a second without movement,
    and every movement with a motive&mdash;musical or dramatic, or
    both. Madame CALVÉ's <i>Santuzza</i> is operatically and
    histrionically&mdash;but especially the latter&mdash;a triumph;
    and "this is the verdict of us all." GIULIA RAVOGLI makes a
    great part of <i>Lola</i>; the many-talented little Mlle.
    BAUERMEISTER's <i>Lucia</i> is not quite up to her own
    <i>Marta</i> in <i>Faust</i>. As for the men, the singing and
    the acting of Signor DE LUCIA as <i>Turiddu</i> (ye gods! what
    a name!), and of Mons. DUFRICHE as <i>Alfio</i> cannot be
    surpassed.</p>

    <p>But&mdash;stop&mdash;the tremendous row (a quarrel quite
    representative of Whitechapel in Italy, and suggesting to some
    of us what Signor Coster CHEVALIER might do if this Opera were
    Londonised) between <i>Turiddu-de-Lucia</i> and
    <i>Santuzza-Calvé</i> is over, the latter has denounced her
    former lover, there is thunder in the air&mdash;the atmosphere
    is heavy with fate&mdash;and the stage is clear. Then comes the
    <i>intermezzo</i>, foreboding ill, presaging
    tragedy,&mdash;magnificent! And as MANCINELLI bows from his
    seat, acknowledges the thunder of applause&mdash;this was the
    thunder in the atmosphere&mdash;and pulls his forces together
    again to repeat and emphasize the triumph&mdash;DRURIOLANUS
    shuts up his lorgnette, beams on the world around, and murmurs
    to himself, "Waterloo is won!" Decides thereupon to give the
    same performance on Thursday, and does so, with repetition of
    triumph.</p>

    <p>Now one word as to a picturesque detail. The action takes
    place on Easter Sunday, not on Palm Sunday; but Archbishop
    DRURIOLANUS has issued a pastoral melody dispensing his flock
    from the usual custom, and allowing them to have the palms
    distributed on Easter Sunday, for the sake of the show.
    "<i>Palmam qui meruit ferat</i>,"&mdash;and well does each one
    of the Chorus deserve his or her palm. And do not those in
    front who are nervous as to splitting their glove-seams, also
    bare their palms to applaud this Opera? Why certainly. Truly,
    Sir DRURIOLANUS ARCHIEPISCOPUS DISPENSATOR, well hast thou
    inaugurated the palmy days of this Opera Season.</p>

    <p><i>Friday</i>.&mdash;<i>Faust</i> selected because
    alliteration in <i>Faust</i> and Friday. A trifle, but as
    DRURIOLANUS says, "The world is governed by trifles." Wise saw
    this, with practical modern instance. VAN DYCK looking like a
    Rembrandt, a Faust-rate <i>Faust</i>, and Miss EMMA EAMES a
    charming <i>Marguerite</i>, Mons. PLANÇON's <i>Mephistopheles à
    la Française</i>. Mons. CESTE good as <i>Valentine</i>. <i>À
    propos</i> of <i>Valentine</i> and his soldiers, why do the
    army and their friends who come to welcome them, invariably
    <i>turn their backs</i> on the triumphal procession, taking no
    sort of interest in it whatever? Also, why is that banner
    persistently and purposelessly waved during the whole of the
    great Soldiers' Chorus? Is this <i>the</i> reason why nowadays
    the ever-popular Soldiers' Chorus is seldom encored? As this
    monotonous action on the part of the Bannerman (not CAMPBELL of
    that ilk, but the ensign-bearing supernumerary) suggests
    "flagging interest," hadn't it better be abolished
    altogether?</p>

    <p><i>Saturday</i>.&mdash;Great excitement in outer Hall.
    Everybody buzzing about. What has happened? Has dynamite been
    found? Has some eminent vocalist "gone up to see," and can't
    come down again in time? Sir DRURIOLANUS is present, explaining
    matters to the critics, and repeating explanation in various
    tongues to eager foreign inquirers. The sentinels eye the
    moving scene with determination and bayonets fixed. At a word
    from Sir DRURIOLANUS, they will give an extra charge, and rout
    the crowd. "What is it all about?" asks little PETERKIN. Sir
    DRURIOLANUS can tell him. Madame CALVÉ is indisposed, and
    <i>L'Amico Fritz</i> cannot be performed. So GLUCK's
    <i>Orfeo</i> is substituted in a happy-g'lucky sort of way. The
    two RAVOGLI are excellent, and Box and Stall are satisfied.</p>

    <p>"MRS. HENNIKER," my Baronite writes, "dedicates to her
    brother, Lord HOUGHTON, her first essay in fiction, on the
    ground that he will be the most kindly critic. <i>Bid me
    Good-bye</i> (BENTLEY) does not stand in need of the
    adventitious aid of fraternal kindliness to recommend it to the
    reader. The story of woman's sacrifice to a sense of duty has
    been told before; but Mrs. HENNIKER endows her version with a
    charm of simplicity under which, here and there, glows the fire
    of passion. Moreover, she writes excellent English, which
    ladies who make books do sometimes. It is a pity the story is
    so sad. <i>Colonel St. Aubyn</i> might just as well have
    married <i>Mary Giffard</i>, and lived ever after in that
    charming Brereton Royal which Mrs. HENNIKER doubtless sketches
    from life. If she had insisted on his being a cripple for life,
    her dictum could not have been disputed. But there ought to
    have been a union between <i>William</i> and <i>Mary</i>."</p>

    <p>REPORTED DISAPPEARANCE OF THE BROAD GAUGE.&mdash;It has been
    "converted," and in this sense our old friend, The Broad Gauge,
    with its easy-going ways, is defunct for ever. Is the
    conversion for the better? From "broad" to "narrow" is not,
    ordinarily speaking, beneficial to the individual or to
    society. And as applied to lines that fall in such pleasant
    places as do those of the Great Western, will the change to
    "narrow" result in the same breadth of view which the
    passengers have hitherto enjoyed? Will the ideas of the
    management and direction of the G.W.R. change from "broad" to
    "narrow"? We see it mentioned that the "cross sleepers" have
    been disturbed and re-laid (enough to make them crosser than
    ever; the ceremony should have been accompanied by a band
    playing selections from "<i>The Sleeper Awakened</i>"), and
    that "an inner row of chairs" is already fixed. But chairs are
    not so comfortable for sleepers as the good old-fashioned
    broad-gauge-G.-W.-R. first-class seat, in which, after you had
    lunched, you could repose from Swindon to Exeter. However, we
    all know the safety of choosing the "narrow" in preference to
    the "broad" way in life, and so, no doubt, the
    spiritually-minded Directors of the G.W.R. have acted with the
    best intentions and upon the most unanimous resolutions. Yet
    "intentions" or "resolutions" are more compatible with the
    "broad" than the "narrow" way.</p>

    <h2>LADY GAY'S SELECTIONS.</h2>

    <p>DEAR MR. PUNCH,&mdash;My dear friend, Lady HARRIET ENTOUCAS,
    said to me, the other day at Kempton, when I told her to have a
    sovereign on <i>Conifer</i>:&mdash;"My dear Lady GAY, your tips
    are so marvellous that I really wonder you don't write to the
    papers!" Being struck with the idea, my thoughts naturally flew
    to you&mdash;not only as the most gallant Editor of my
    acquaintance, but also as probably the only one hitherto
    unrepresented with a regular Turf Correspondent.</p>

    <p>It is, therefore, with true feminine confidence that I place
    my services at your disposal, and, my information being of the
    most unreliable description (derived invariably from the
    owners), I feel sure that those of your readers who follow my
    tips will have no cause to regret their temerity, as, being
    like all women, nothing if not original, I intend to tip, not
    the probable <i>winner</i>, but the probable <i>last</i> horse
    in important races!</p>

    <p>As I invariably attend all the fashionable meetings and most
    of the unfashionable (incognito of course the latter), it can
    be left to <i>me</i> to decide which horse was last&mdash;thus
    reducing the matter to a <i>certainty</i>&mdash;distinctly an
    object to be gained in making a bet&mdash;whatever <i>men</i>
    may say to the contrary.</p>

    <p>An ancestor of mine (the poet of the name)&mdash;having
    transmitted to me a spark of his genius&mdash;I propose to give
    my selections in verse&mdash;select verse in fact, and will now
    in concluding my letter, give my tip for the probable last
    horse in the Derby&mdash;(which, by the way, happens in this
    case to be a mare&mdash;I repeat&mdash;I am nothing if not
    original!)&mdash;and, before doing so, I should like to express
    my sympathy with the Duke of WESTMINSTER and JOHN PORTER, who
    have indeed had an Orme-ful of trouble with the unfortunate
    erstwhile Derby Favourite, which would undoubtedly have been my
    selection had he not been scratched! Yours devotedly,</p>

    <h2>FAIR TRADERS.</h2>

    <p>Lady friend of my wife's wants us to "try her tea"! Seems
    she's started (with two other Ladies) as Firm of Tea Merchants
    in City. What <i>are</i> we coming to? Or rather, what are male
    Tea Merchants coming to? Mr. Registrar BROUGHAM, most likely.
    In incautious moment&mdash;as I was out&mdash;wife promised to
    give her an order for a couple of pounds of her "best Ceylon
    Mixture."</p>

    <p>Tried it. Never tasted such vile stuff! Wife agrees, and
    asks me to call at the Firm's Offices and see if they haven't
    got anything with more Ceylon and less Mixture in it. Don't
    much like the job. How can one blow up a woman whom one will
    have to meet in one's own drawing-room, calling?</p>

    <p>Have looked in. Must say that Tea-dealeress is better than
    her tea. Really quite an attractive person. The three of them
    gave me afternoon tea in a little sanctum behind the shop, and
    chatted <i>most</i> pleasantly. My wife's friend the head of
    Firm. Said the Ceylon Mixture was a mistake&mdash;really
    intended for kitchen use&mdash;but as they've only just started
    business, their stocks have got jumbled together. She
    hoped&mdash;quite penitently&mdash;that I would "overlook the
    error."</p>

    <p>What <i>could</i> I say? What I <i>did</i> was to order a
    whole box of their "Incomparable Congou," at four shillings a
    pound.</p>

    <p>Wife (when I tell her of this) seems surprised. Says "she
    won't send <i>me</i> shopping again." But can one call this
    cosy&mdash;this tea-cosy&mdash;social visit to three
    accomplished women by the vulgar term "shopping "?</p>

    <p>Wife incautiously mentions that she is "out of Coffee."
    Gives me an excuse to call on Firm again, and see if they sell
    Coffee too. Yes, they do. Head of Firm more fascinating than
    ever. Asks me "if I would mind, as a very great favour,
    mentioning her tea to all my City friends? She <i>knows</i> I
    have great influence in the City." Says this with winning
    smile. Query&mdash;is not <i>Mincing</i> Lane rather an
    appropriate locality for Lady Tea-dealers?</p>

    <p>Later. Wife has forbidden my ever going to Mincing Lane
    again! Says the box of "Incomparable Congou" was mere "dust."
    So are my hopes!</p>

    <h2>FROM THE SHADES.</h2>

    <h4>(<i>At the Sign of the "Castor and Pollux."</i>)</h4>

    <p>DEAR MISTER PUNCH,&mdash;Look at 'ere! This is not one of
    your penny papers&mdash;there was none on 'em in <i>my</i>
    time&mdash;ups and says, says it:&mdash;"The travelling
    expenses from America of Mr. JACKSON, who is coming to England
    to fight Mr. SLAVIN for the Championship of the World, are
    reckoned at no less than £150."</p>

    <p>Wy, wot a delikit plarnt, wot a blooming hexotic, this
    "Mister" JACKSON (oh, the pooty perliteness of it!) must be!
    Saloon passage and fust-class fare, I persoom, for the likes of
    <i>'im</i>. Isters and champagne, no doubt, and liquoor brandy,
    and sixpenny smokes! A poor old pug like me wos glad of a steak
    and inguns, and a 'arf ounce o' shag, with a penny clay. And as
    to "travelling hexpenses"&mdash;I wonder wot the Noble Captings
    of <i>our</i> day would 'ave said to the accounts laid afore
    your "National Sporting Club!" £2000 for the Purse, and £150
    for Mister JACKSON's travelling hexpenses!!! Oh, I say! Pugs
    <i>is</i> a-looking up! And yet I'm told some o' your
    cockered-up fly-flappers carnt 'it a 'ole in a pound o' butter,
    or stand a straight nose-ender without turning faint! Evidently
    funking <i>and</i> faking pays a jolly sight better than
    'onesty and 'ard 'itting.</p>

    <p>Well, well, <i>Mister Punch</i>, I'm hout of it now,
    thanksbe. And I ain't sure as I could shape myself 'andy to the
    Slugger SULLIVAN and JEM SMITH kind o' caper. The "resources o'
    science" is so remarkable different from what they wos in
    <i>my</i> days, and include so many new-fangled barnies as we
    worn't hup to. These 'ere pugilistic horchids, so to speak,
    wants deliket 'andling <i>in</i> the Ring, as well as hout on
    it, and a fair 'ammering from a 'onest bunch o' fives might
    spile the pooty look of 'em for their fust-clarss Saloons,
    Privet Boxes, and Swell Clubs. But you can tell Mister JACKSON,
    Eskvire, an cetrer, an cetrer, an cetrer (put it all in,
    please, Sir, as I vant to be perlite), that in my day I'd a bin
    only too 'appy to fight 'im to a finish (which mighn't ha' bin
    in five minutes, either, hunless he wanted it so),
    for&mdash;his Travelling Hexpenses!!!</p>

    <h2>"ONE TOUCH OF NATURE."</h2>

    <p>To introduce in a monument to a great writer a presentment
    of one of his most popular characters, as Mr. F. EDWIN ELWELL
    has done in his bronze statue of "<i>Charles Dickens and
    'Little Nell,'</i>" is decidedly a pretty notion. "The child,"
    looking up into the face of the great creative genius, who
    loved this offspring of his sympathetic fancy better than did
    all her other admirers, is a pathetic figure, and gives to the
    monument a more human and less coldly mortuary aspect than,
    unhappily, is usual in such work. It is a "touch of Nature"
    that makes even the adjunct of the mausoleum akin to the quick
    world of the living and loving. The vivid valiant genius, who
    so detested and denounced the superfluous horrors with which we
    surround death and the tomb, would cordially have approved it,
    little as was his love for monumental effigies, or care for the
    fame that is dependent on them.</p>
    <hr />

    <p>VERY "FRENCH BEFORE BREAKFAST."&mdash;It was reported in the
    <i>Times</i> that a M. ROULEZ fought four duels between nine
    and ten on Wednesday morning, severely wounded his four
    adversaries, and then, after this morning's pleasure, went
    about his business, that is his ordinary business, as if
    nothing particular had happened. To this accomplished swordsman
    the series of combats had been merely like taking a little
    gentle exercise "<i>pour faire Rouler le sang</i>." The
    combatants, as it turns out, appear to have been like
    <i>Falstaff's</i> "men in buckram."</p>
    <hr />

    <p>THE LIMB AND THE LAW.&mdash;"To whom does an amputated limb
    belong?" queries the <i>Standard</i> (<i>à propos</i> of the
    case of the boy HOUSLEY, whose father demanded that the arm cut
    off in the Infirmary should be given up to him). The answer is
    clear. An amputated limb belongs to <i>no body</i>!</p>

    <h2>ESSENCE OF PARLIAMENT.</h2>

    <h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

    <p><i>House of Commons, Monday, May 16.</i>&mdash;This looked
    forward to in advance as grand field-night. SQUIRE OF MALWOOD
    been preparing onslaught on JOKIM's last Budget. Should have
    come off days ago, but Squire had other engagements in the
    country. Nothing to equal Prince ARTHUR's accommodating spirit.
    If the Squire not ready to demolish Budget, say, on Thursday,
    well, it shall be put off till Monday, or even later if that
    day not convenient. JOKIM doesn't mind; accustomed to have his
    Budgets torn up, and the little pieces returned to him postage
    unpaid; would feel lonely if Budget went through an
    uninterrupted course. Arranged accordingly that to-night the
    great onslaught shall he delivered. The Squire judiciously
    spent interval since Friday amidst quiet glades of Malwood.</p>

    <p>"I always like, TOBY," he said, "if I get a chance, to have
    Monday set apart for one of my more important speeches. I make
    a point of going to the morning service on the day which,
    happily still, lies 'tween Saturday and Monday, and I don't
    know anything more conducive to the preparation of impromptus
    than a good sermon read out for space of twenty minutes; not
    more, or your wit begins to falter and you repeat yourself;
    just twenty minutes. A moderately comfortable pew, a voice not
    too loud in the pulpit, a fairly full congregation, and a
    general sense that you're doing the right thing and setting an
    example to your neighbours. Such circumstances preceding by
    some twenty-four hours my rising in the Commons, are calculated
    to make JOKIM sit up."</p>

    <div class="figright"
         style="width:28%;">
        <a href="images/264-1.png"><img width="100%"
             src="images/264-1.png"
             alt="Waiting!" /></a>Waiting!
    </div>

    <p>Calculation on this occasion somewhat astray. Rather hard to
    sit up all the way through the Squire's speech; an hour and a
    half long; bristling with figures; mellifluous with millions,
    throbbing with thousands. The Squire is in peculiar degree
    dependent for success upon mood of his audience. In crowded
    House, Members cheering, laughing, or, if you please, jeering
    and howling, the Squire improves with every five minutes of his
    Speech. To-night House not a quarter full; those present
    depressed with consciousness that no real fight meant; Mr. G.
    sat it out with some intervals of suspicious quietude. HENRY
    FOWLER also faithful found; sitting with folded arms waiting
    for the time when a new Chancellor of the Exchequer shall find
    opening made for him on a newly-arranged Treasury Bench.</p>

    <p>Only JOKIM really listened; nervous, restless, murmuring
    comment, muttering contradiction, clutching at himself with
    strange gestures reminiscent of hereditary instinct to rend his
    garments in moments of tribulation. That was something in
    recompense for the meditations of yesterday morning. But as one
    swallow does not make a summer, neither does one Minister,
    however unhappy under criticism, make an audience. JOKIM
    followed with a speech scrupulously measured as to length by
    that of the Squire's; through the dead unhappy night the rain
    of talk fell on the roof, and everyone was glad when midnight,
    slowly coming, struck.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Budget Resolutions agreed
    to.</p>

    <p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Small Holdings Bill through Committee.
    Last clause added amid buzz of admiration from a not too full
    House.</p>

    <div class="figleft"
         style="width:25%;">
        <a href="images/264-2.png"><img width="100%"

             alt="'In rapt admiration!'" /></a>"In rapt
             admiration!"
    </div>

    <p>HAMLEY looked on in rapt admiration.</p>

    <p>JESSE COLLINGS rose up and called CHAPLIN blessed.</p>

    <p>"Not at all," said CHAPLIN, blushing; "as my friend TOOLE
    says from the deck of the Houseboat, anyone could do it."</p>

    <p>"The fact is, TOBY," CHAPLIN whispered to me a little later,
    as we sat on the Terrace sharing a bottle of gingerbeer imbibed
    through a couple of straws, "I've really done a clever thing,
    only those fellows don't quite see it. Here we've been for a
    week pegging away at this Bill, bargaining and bickering.
    Sometimes I've yielded a trifle to the Opposition; sometimes I
    haven't. But it's pretty much all the same in the end. The Act
    will look very well in the Statute Book, and I hope will help
    us at the General Election. But as far as practical use goes, I
    have sometimes laughed when I look round the Committee and see
    Members seriously discussing the thing. Just before the Bill
    was printed, Prince ARTHUR asked me when I proposed the Act
    should come into operation. 'When are you going to have the
    General Election?' I asked, by way of reply. Prince ARTHUR said
    he couldn't exactly tell at the moment. 'Very well,' I said;
    'let us put it this way. If you're going to dissolve at the end
    of June, the Act may as well come into operation as soon as it
    receives Royal Assent. But if you postpone Election over
    Autumn, better fix date for Act coming into force on the first
    of January. 'What d'you mean?' asked ARTHUR. 'I mean just this.
    If this Bill's to help us at the General Election, we mustn't
    give time for people to find it out.' 'Um!' said ARTHUR, and he
    can put a good deal of meaning into the observation."</p>

             alt="Admiral Jeremiah Field." /></a>Admiral Jeremiah
             Field.
    </div>

    <p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Admiral JEREMIAH FIELD pacing
    quarter-deck, uttering lamentations over collapse of the
    Eastbourne stand against the Salvationists. Bill amending
    Eastbourne Improvement Act up for Third Reading. JEREMIAH had
    proposed to introduce Clause enabling inhabitants of town to
    protect themselves against the Sabbath incursions of a mob in
    red waistcoats and poke bonnets, with drums, trumpets also, and
    shawms. Evidently no use; so the Admiral lowered his topsails,
    pulled taut his lee scuppers, and sheered off. "We're living in
    flabby times," he complained to sympathetic House.</p>

    <p>He heaved one sigh, then he hove-to, and Bill read Third
    Time.</p>

    <p>Truth of Admiral's remark about living in flabby times
    proved through rest of Sitting. "Don't," said GEORGE TREVELYAN,
    yesterday, speaking about RUSSELL's Amendment on Plurality of
    Vote Bill&mdash;"don't drag this ghost of a dead red-herring
    across the path." Only the imagination of genius could conjure
    up this terrible vision. Realised it to-night when Irish Local
    Government Bill took the floor, and asked to be read a Second
    Time. Thought it was as dead as a herring, red or otherwise;
    but here's its ghost filling House with gloom. Promise of
    several days' cheerful conversation. SEXTON promptly turned on
    flood of everlasting talk, hopelessly swamping place to begin
    with. Here's a Bill no one believes Government seriously intend
    to proceed with; still feel bound, having introduced it, to
    take Second Reading. Must show it's not quite so ridiculous as
    it seemed when, three months ago, Prince ARTHUR introduced it,
    and House laughed it off premises. Sensible course suggested at
    close of Sitting by WILFRID LAWSOW. "Scandalous waste of time,"
    he said; "the sooner we finish Debate the better."</p>

    <p>SEXTON full of scorn for the hapless measure. Looked it all
    over, and behold! there is no good thing in it. Might have said
    this in ten minutes, or at most, quarter of an hour. But
    temptation to straddle irresistible; discoursed for full hour
    and half; talked clean out of Peers' Gallery FIFE and Earl
    SPENCER, who had innocently looked in. MADDEN, not to be
    outdone, talked for another hour and half; out of a possible
    seven hours' debate three appropriated by two speakers. Quite
    Maddening. Afterwards, RATHBONE, JOHNSTON (of Ballykilbeg),
    WEBB, COGHILL, BLANE, and AMBROSE.</p>

    <p>A weary world, my masters!</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

    <p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;Morning Sitting for further discussion
    of Local Government Bill. Only four Members spoke, each Member
    at terrible length. At this rate quite clear, if every Member
    is to have his say&mdash;and why shouldn't he?&mdash;House must
    sit into August before even Second Reading stage of Bill is
    disposed of. Should have been Evening Sitting, but things
    rapidly approaching collapse. Members in state of coma.
    Couldn't get forty together; and as soon as SPEAKER took chair
    Counted Out.</p>

    <p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None.</p>

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
